        <p style="text-align:center;">One similarity between Scratch and Python is the basic syntax. Differences include extra features in Python, for eg. having to import time and turtle at the beginning. At first I was confused with Python and it was daunting, but once we actualy started to code for shapes, it wasn't as hard as I thought! The program is similar to Scratch in concept. Finding certain functions was sometimes difficult, like "wait", since it was different from scratch and what we've experienced before.</p>

         <p style="text-align:center;">I believe that robot hold the capability to help other people. There really is no limit to what these robots can do. One caveat to this, though, is that too much reliance on robots can lead to false security, and disasters may ensue if a robot malfunctions. Working in groups allowed for a faster and more diverse flow of ideas. I liked working in groups, but one hard part is that the robots are so tiny, only two or one person can really be hads on at a time. We should always take turns with the robots.</p>

           <p>When you turn on the power, one of the green LEDs lights up. When you press down on a button, the yellow LED lights up. When you press the other button, 2 green LEDs and 1 red LED light up! One problem that I encountered is with the button. The words on the button need to be sideways in order for the circuit to work (AKA the button legs must face outwards towards the sides)! You can put the LEDs in series or in parallel. The button needs to be in series with the LED. The 5 pins are connected horixontally, but in order for the circuit to move vertically, you must connect the pins through a jumper wire, resistor, button, or LED. You mUST use a resistor IN FRONT of an LED, or else the LED will burn out.</p>
